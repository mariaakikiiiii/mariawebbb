      <h2>What is a Web Browser?</h2>
      <p>A web browser is software that enables you to access the internet, search and read information, work and access all types of services, per your connection to the internet. It's through the use of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol, HTTP, that's it's used to share and display that information, i.e. images, text, and videos, in a standard format that can be displayed in any browser.  
        Browsers receive data from the servers and interpret it into HTML code, the universal language used by programmers to build web pages. With this, the information is rendered on the screen of the device used (computer, tablet, or smartphone), so that the user can continue to browse the World Wide Web.  
        There are currently different web browsers, each with its own histories and special techniques that distinguish them from their competitors. However, the web standards published by the W3C, the world organization responsible for developing web protocols, enable the information associated with each web page to be displayed in all browsers, if differently.<br></p>

      <h4>Web browsers have evolved significantly from early text-based interfaces to today’s advanced platforms (SmartBear, n.d.; GeeksforGeeks, 2023; Telefónica, 2022).</h4>

      <h2>Browser Timeline</h2>
      <p>There's an entire history of web browsers. Before the web browsers we knew today, there were the first browsers, which are no longer in use or have highly evolved.<br>
          1990 - The WorldWideWeb was the first browser ever created by W3C Director Tim Berners-Lee, then renamed Nexus to differentiate from the actual World Wide Web. Unlike today, this was the only browser and the only way to access the web.<br>
          1992 - Lynx was a texted-based browser that couldn't display any graphic content.<br>
          1993 - Mosaic was the first browser to allow images embedded in text making it “the world’s first most popular browser”.<br>
          1994 -- A noticeable improvement to Mosaic came Netscape Navigator.<br>
          1995 - Internet Explorer made its debut as Microsoft's first web browser.<br>
          1996 - Opera started as a research project in 1994 that finally went public two years later. This was also arguably the beginning of the browser wars, mainly between IE 3 and Navigator 3 as Internet Explorer inched ahead with new capabilities.<br>
          2003 - Apple's Safari browser was released specifically for Macintosh computers instead of Navigator.<br>
          2004 - Mozilla launched Firefox as Netscape Navigator faded out.<br>
          2007 - Mobile Safari was introduced as Apple's mobile web browser and continues to dominate the iOS market.<br>
          2008 - Google Chrome appeared to soon take over the browser market.<br>
          2011 - Opera Mini was released to focus on the fast-growing mobile browser market.<br>
          2015 - Microsoft Edge was born to combat Google.</p>

      <h3>An Overview of web browsers functionality</h3>
      <p>Web browsers are software programs that provide an interface or medium for users to connect with the web. It receives requests sent by users, 
        fetches data from web servers, and then displays the result to the user.<br>
        The user always searches in the form of a URL and sends a request to the browser.<br>
        Then the browser converts the URL into a numeric value, which is called an IP address, using DNS, or Domain Name System.<br>
        Through the IP address, web browsers generate a request, which is sent to the web servers.<br>
        The data retrieved from the server (which is in the form of code) is parsed, and then when the entire document object model is created, it is presented to users in the form of web pages.<br></p>
